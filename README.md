# Personal Website

Source code for my personal website and blog. Built with Astro and some tears by a Data Engineer learning about the chaotic front end world.

## Development

You can use the Development Container environment to develop locally. Once inside the container, you can also use the `Makefile` to run serve the content locally.

## Deployment

Pushing to the `main` branch will trigger a new deployment! The website is hosted on GitHub Pages.

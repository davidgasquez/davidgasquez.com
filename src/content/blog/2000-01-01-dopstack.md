- Modular and open data stack: (Data, Orchestrator, Parquet) Stack
- build and deploy phase, do to your data what you do to your static site
  - build phase: extract, load, transform, validate, test, etc. Save the output to a parquet file and run your notebooks/analysis on it.
  - deploy phase: put the parquet file somewhere, serve those analysis. Need to explore the data? Use DuckDB Shell or Colab or download the parquet file and use your favorite tool.
- The same way you probably don't have big data, you probably don't need the database for your weekly report being idle 90% of the time. Pulling all the data every day might come up cheaper than maintaining a stateful database all day online with heterogeneous workloads.
- this is similar to [Simon Willison baked data](https://simonwillison.net/2021/Jul/28/baked-data/) idea or the Splitgraph approach.

> **What is Jamstack?**
> Jamstack is an architectural approach that decouples the web experience layer from data and business logic, improving flexibility, scalability, performance, and maintainability.
> It enables a composable architecture for the web where custom logic and 3rd party services are consumed through APIs.
